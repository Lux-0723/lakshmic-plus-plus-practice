Write a program to find the distance between 2 points using functions.

Input Format:

Input consists of 4 integers. The first and second integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the first point. The third and fourth integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the second point.

Output Format:

Output consists of a single floating point number (correct to 2 decimal places.) Refer sample output for formatting details.

Sample Input:

3

6

4

3

Sample Output:

Distance between the 2 points is 3.16
code:
#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
int distance(int x1,int x2,int y1, int y2,int x,int y)
{
    return (sqrt(pow(x,2))+(pow(y,2)));
}
int main()
{
    float distance;
    int x1,x2,y1,y2,x,y;
    cin>>x1>>y1>>x2>>y2;
    x=x2-x1;
    y=y2-y1;
    distance=sqrt((pow(x,2))+(pow(y,2)));
    printf("Distance between the 2 points is %.2f",distance);
    
}
