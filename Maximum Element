Write a program to find the maximum element in an array using functions.

Function specifications for the function details:

The first argument corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The second argument corresponds to the pointer to an array.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.

 

Output consists of a single integer which corresponds to the maximum element in an array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.


Sample Input :

5

2

4

1

3

5

Sample Output :

The maximum element in the array is 5
code:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int max(int n)
{
    int i;
    int a[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        
        cin>>a[i];
    }
